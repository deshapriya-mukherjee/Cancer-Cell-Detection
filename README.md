# Cancer-Cell-Detection
Cancer Cell Detection using Support Vector Machine

We use Support Vector Machine(SVM) to build and train a model using human cell records, and classify cells to whether the samples are benign or malignant.

###  Load the Cancer data 
The example is based on a dataset that is publicly available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (Asuncion and Newman, 2007)[http://mlearn.ics.uci.edu/MLRepository.html]. The dataset consists of several hundred human cell sample records, each of which contains the values of a set of cell characteristics. The fields in each record are:

|Field name|Description|
|--- |--- |
|ID|Clump thickness|
|Clump|Clump thickness|
|UnifSize|Uniformity of cell size|
|UnifShape|Uniformity of cell shape|
|MargAdh|Marginal adhesion|
|SingEpiSize|Single epithelial cell size|
|BareNuc|Bare nuclei|
|BlandChrom|Bland chromatin|
|NormNucl|Normal nucleoli|
|Mit|Mitoses|
|Class|Benign or malignant|
